        	<h2>Domovoi is built to be used across a variety of devices</h2>
        	<p>
        		Built from the ground up for the mobile web, Domovoi makes any 
        		almost any device with a web browser into a home control interface.  
        		Domovoi lets you watch your home's IP cameras, adjust wifi lighting 
        		and much more from the convenience of your phone, tablet, laptop, or
        		a wide selection of devices with browser capabilities.

        	<h2>Let Domovoi take control over your home's schedule</h2>
        	<p>
        		Domovoi can save you time and money by scheduling your home's
        		functionality.  With intuitive scheduling features, Domovoi takes
        		control of when lights are on or off, cameras are watching for
        		movement, networked appliances are operating and more.  Spend less
        		time making sure the lights are turned off at night, pay less at the
        		meter when nobody's home, and never have to think twice about it.    		
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		Or create events for Domovoi to watch for.  Have Domovoi brighten the
        		lights when someone rings the doorbell, or perform any number of
        		responses that Domovoi understands.  Having an impromptu party? Setup
        		a scene so that Domovoi takes care of cranking the lights and disco 
        		music so that you can spend more time getting turnt up.
