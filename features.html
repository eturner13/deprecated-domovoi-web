                <h1>Powerful Management</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>A room with a view...</h2>
            <p>
                Sure, there's a lot that Domovoi can control, and too many controls
                can easily get confusing.  But what if there was a simple way to manage
                that power in a way that makes perfect sense?  Introducing Domovoi's Room 
                View, a sleek interface that organizes your home the way you do: by the 
                room.  Each room is individually represented with controls specfic to the
                devices relevant to the area.  No need to dig through menus to make simple
                or complex tweaks, and multiple rooms can be controlled in paralel.

                <h1>Scheduling and Events</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>A time for change...</h2>
            <p>
                There's not much that can be more gratifying than when things just work,
                and work without having to be constantly managed.  Domovoi's scheduling
                feature is a painless way to organize the small but important details
                of managing a home.  Set schemes for various times of the day, such as less
                lighting during daylight hours, or mood lighting for when the hour strikes
                late.  Set cameras to record or sense motion only during selected hours.
                Use schemes to set the perfect tone for the spontaneous event, or as a
                response to a triggered event.  Walking to the kitchen for a late night snack?
                Let Domovoi light your path as you travel through the home, and stop becoming
                the thing that goes bump in the night.

                <h1>Lights</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>Setting the scene...</h2>
            <p>
                Countless studies have shown that as a species, we're very affected by
                the light environment (or light pollution in some cases) that we surround
                ourselves with.  At night, intense light can produce unwanted sleep issues.
                Productivity can be dampened with harsh flourescent lighting.  Waking up to
                a circadian rhythm of soft blue light gradually changing to sunlight can help
                make mornings paced, graceful and, for some, tolerable.  Of course, sometimes
                we just want to dance to disco light show.  Or a comforting, toe-stub
                preventing night-light.  Domovoi makes full use of the latest in network
                connected LED lights, changing brightness, colors and color temperature with
                ease, and can even work with LED strip lighting for the ultimate dazzling 
                light show.

                <h1>Cameras</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>A watchful eye...</h2>
            <p>
                Keeping watch over your home is a job Domovoi takes seriously, and it has
                the tools to get the job done.  Capable of recording constantly or
                only when motion is detected, Domovoi lets you choose the options that work
                for your lifestyle needs and storage capacities.  Get alerts when Domovoi
                detects something, or have it respond with lighting, audio or other connected
                devices.

            </header>
            <h2>A world of possibilities...</h2>
            <p>
                Domovoi is designed with the future in mind and built for adaptation as new
                networked appliances emerge.  With the ability to send commands to a host of 
                external devices, the only limit to what Domovoi can handle is your imagination.
                Updates are always adding new functionality, but never outside of familiar
                controls that you're already comfortable using.
